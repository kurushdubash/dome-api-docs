title: "Wallet Profit-and-Loss"
description: "Fetches the **realized** profit and loss (PnL) for a specific wallet address over a specified time range and granularity. Note*: this will differ to what you see on Polymarket's dashboard since Polymarket showcases historical unrealized PnL. This API tracks realized gains only - from either confirmed sells or redeems. We do not realize a gain/loss until a finished market is redeemed."
openapi: "GET /polymarket/wallet/pnl/{wallet_address}"
