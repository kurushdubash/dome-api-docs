    "platform": "polymarket",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "orders",
    "filters": {
        "market_slugs": [
            "btc-updown-15m-1762755300"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Parameters

- `action`: Must be `"subscribe"`
- `platform`: Must be `"polymarket"`
- `version`: Currently `1`
- `type`: Must be `"orders"`
- `filters.market_slugs`: Array of market slug strings

## Multiple Market Slugs

You can track multiple markets in a single subscription:

```json
{
    "action": "subscribe",
    "platform": "polymarket",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "orders",
    "filters": {
        "market_slugs": [
            "btc-updown-15m-1762755300",
            "eth-price-2024-12-31"
        ]
    }
}
```

You'll receive order events when trades occur in any of the specified markets.
