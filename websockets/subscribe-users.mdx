## Overview

Filter orders by specific wallet addresses to track trades from particular users. You can also use a wildcard to receive all trades (Dev tier only).

## Subscription Format

```json
{
    "action": "subscribe",
    "platform": "polymarket",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "orders",
    "filters": {
        "users": [
            "0x6031b6eed1c97e853c6e0f03ad3ce3529351f96d",
            "0x7c3db723f1d4d8cb9c550095203b686cb11e5c6b"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Filter Options

### Specific Wallet Addresses

Provide an array of wallet addresses to track:

```json
{
    "action": "subscribe",
    "platform": "polymarket",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "orders",
    "filters": {
        "users": [
            "0x6031b6eed1c97e853c6e0f03ad3ce3529351f96d",
            "0x7c3db723f1d4d8cb9c550095203b686cb11e5c6b"
        ]
    }
}
```

You'll receive order events when any of the specified wallet addresses execute trades.

### Wildcard - All Trades

<Warning>
The wildcard option (`"*"`) is only available on **Dev tier** and above due to high egress costs. Free tier users cannot use this feature.
</Warning>

To receive all trades across Polymarket, use a wildcard:

```json
{
    "action": "subscribe",
    "platform": "polymarket",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "orders",
    "filters": {
        "users": ["*"]
    }
}
```

This will stream all order events from Polymarket. **Note:** This feature requires a Dev tier subscription or higher.
