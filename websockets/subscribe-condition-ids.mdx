    "platform": "polymarket",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "orders",
    "filters": {
        "condition_ids": [
            "0x17815081230e3b9c78b098162c33b1ffa68c4ec29c123d3d14989599e0c2e113",

        ]
    }
}
```

You'll receive order events when trades occur for any of the specified condition IDs.
