## What is Dome API?
Dome API provides comprehensive access to prediction market data across multiple platforms including Polymarket and Kalshi. Get real-time market prices, historical candlestick data, wallet analytics, order tracking, and cross-platform market matching. Get started with a free API key [here](https://dashboard.domeapi.io/).

## What are Websockets?

Dome API provides real-time data streaming through WebSocket connections, allowing you to receive live updates for market prices, trades, orderbook changes, and more without constantly polling the REST API.

## Tier Limits

Subscription and wallet tracking limits vary by tier:

| Tier | Subscriptions | Wallets per Subscription |
|------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Free** | 2 | 5 |
| **Dev** | 500 | 500 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom |

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Key

### 2. Connect to the WebSocket

Connect to the Dome API WebSocket endpoint to start receiving real-time data. Below is an example using `wscat`

`wscat -c wss://ws.domeapi.io/<API_KEY_GOES_HERE>`


### 3. WebSocket Actions

Dome API WebSockets support three main actions to manage your real-time data streams:

#### Subscribe

Subscribe to channels to start receiving real-time updates. You can filter orders by:

- **[User addresses](/websockets/subscribe-users)** - Track trades from specific wallets or use a wildcard for all trades (Dev tier only)
- **[Condition IDs](/websockets/subscribe-condition-ids)** - Track trades for specific market conditions
- **[Market slugs](/websockets/subscribe-market-slugs)** - Track all trades within specific markets

```json
{
    "action": "subscribe",
    "platform": "polymarket",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "orders",
    "filters": {
        "users": ["0x6031b6eed1c97e853c6e0f03ad3ce3529351f96d"]
    }
}
```

{

}
```
