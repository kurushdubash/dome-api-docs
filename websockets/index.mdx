## What is Dome API?
Dome API provides comprehensive access to prediction market data across multiple platforms including Polymarket and Kalshi. Get real-time market prices, historical candlestick data, wallet analytics, order tracking, and cross-platform market matching.

## What are Websockets?

Dome API provides real-time data streaming through WebSocket connections, allowing you to receive live updates for market prices, trades, orderbook changes, and more without constantly polling the REST API.

## Tier Limits

| Tier | Subscriptions | Wallets per Subscription |
|------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Free** | 2 | 5 |
| **Dev** | 500 | 500 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom |

### 2. Connect to the WebSocket

Connect to the Dome API WebSocket endpoint to start receiving real-time data. Below is an example using `wscat`

`wscat -c wss://ws.domeapi.io/<API_KEY_GOES_HERE>`


### 3. Subscribe to Channels

Subscribe to specific channels to receive updates for the data you need.

Example subscription: 
```json
{
    "action": "subscribe",
    "platform": "polymarket",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "orders",
    "filters": {
        "users": [
            "0x6031b6eed1c97e853c6e0f03ad3ce3529351f96d", "0x7c3db723f1d4d8cb9c550095203b686cb11e5c6b"
        ]
    }
}
```

As trades come in, orders that have a user who matches your filter on the users field will be sent you:

Example message recieved:
```json
{
    "type": "event",
    "subscription_id": "sub_m58zfduokmd",
    "data":
    {
        "token_id": "57564352641769637293436658960633624379577489846300950628596680893489126052038",

### 4. Unsubscribe to Channels

Example:
